# What's for Dinner?
**Functionality:
  What's for dinner? The ultimate question. This application generates a new random side, main dish, dessert, or the whole enchildada (pun intended) for those visitors who brought a real appetite. At login, a user is promted to enter their name and will be relocated to the main application page with a customized greeting. If a user doesn't want to be enticed by a randomly selected course option from a pre-populated list, they can add a recipe of their own! This recipe has to fit into the provided course categories, or else you will get an error message. The user can hit a clear button anytime that they want to clear out an added recipe of their own or one from the pre-populated list! BON APPETIT!

##Technologies used:
  -Javascript
  -HyperText Markup Language (HTML), semantic-mostly, hopefully...I tried!
  -CSS
  -Atom text editor

##Special notes:
  -Added the following files within the assets directory:
    - pot-kitchen.svg, which is used on the "login" page
    - data.js, which was used to house the food object from which random lists of sides, main dishes, and desserts were taken. This was done in an effort to keep the main.js file a little more manageable.
